# ImageRecognition

This is a Python facial recognition project using OpenCV and Tkinter. I have trained the recognizer with a few presidents around the world. 

I will eventually add more data to make it a comprehensive facial recognition program for the leaders of every country. Make sure to watch the demo of the project in order to understand how it works.

I am also adding a video for how to post and fetch image data to firebase. Link to this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3svwJNl7AI&t=1s
